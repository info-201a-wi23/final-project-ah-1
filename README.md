# Introduction
For our final project, we will be analyzing New York City's Minority and Women-owned Business Enterprise (M/WBE), Emerging Business Enterprise (EBE), and Locally-based Business Enterprise (LBE) certified businesses related to the construction industry.

We intend to explore to which extent do minority and women-owned businesses are represented in NYC's diverse communities, to identify potential areas of opportunity for contractors and vendors, and to analyze trends in the growth and success of certified businesses over time.

Despite the efforts to promote diversity, there are still disparities and inequalities in the distribution of business opportunities. Through this project, we aim to answer the following research questions:

1. In terms of race and ethnicity, how does the demographic representation of minority-owned businesses in New York City compare to the city's overall demographic? The purpose of this question is to reveal how well these minority- and women-owned certified businesses represent the city's diverse communities.

2. What is the city's geographic distribution of certified businesses?  The purpose of this question is to reveal inequalities in the distribution of opportunities for minority- and women-owned businesses across the city.

3. What has happened to the number of certified businesses over time? The purpose of this question is to reveal trends and patterns in the growth and success of the city's minority and women-owned businesses, which can be used to help decide future policies regarding this certification program.

The dataset that we will be using is titled: the NYC M/WBE, LBE, and EBE Certified Business List dataset, which is publicly available on the New York City Department of Small Business Services (SBS) website as well as on Kaggle where we obtained it.

This dataset contains information on M/WBEs, LBEs, and EBEs certified by the city (thus the dataset contain business from outside New York, in fact, it is spreaded to over 33 states) and includes details such as the company name, address, industry, certification type, and more. The dataset is regularly updated to reflect changes in the certification status of businesses.

Like all data, this dataset has limitations and ethical questions we need to consider. For example, it only includes businesses certified by NYC as M/WBE, LBE, or EBE, leaving out other diverse businesses. This lack of representation could lead to issues of equity. Also, we don't know how often women and minorities receive EBE and LBE licenses, and there may be an overlap between owners of these licenses. Additionally, the data doesn't provide information on how the city chooses who gets licenses, which could create inequity in distribution. There are also concerns about data accuracy due to bias and selection bias, as well as potential privacy issues since the dataset includes personal information.

Overall, this project is intended to explore minority and women owned business mainly in New York City, in order to use the analysis to identify opportunity for both vendor and potential contractor. Additionally, we are also raising concern regarding ethical question and limitation of the dataset used.

# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways

After analyzing the data on New York City's Minority and Women-owned Business Enterprise (M/WBE), Emerging Business Enterprise (EBE),and Locally-based Business Enterprise (LBE) certified businesses, there are three specific takeaways that can be made.

Firstly, in terms of race and ethnicity, the representation of minority-owned businesses in New York City is still unequal compared to the city's overall demographic. The bar plot representation of ethnicity data shows that ethnic minorities are still significantly underrepresented. Non-minorities still represent the most at 37% of the observation, followed by African American at 26%, Asian at 21%, and Hispanic at 16%. This suggests that there is a need for more attention and resources to be allocated to allow minority-owned businesses to thrive in these areas.

Secondly, the geographic distribution of certified businesses is also unequal, with some areas having a higher density of businesses than others. The map visualization shows that there are many certified businesses not only in New York but also in other states. However, there are significant disparities in the distribution of opportunities for minority- and women-owned businesses. For instance, from a glance of the map, New York City, in New York has the highest number and density of certified businesses, while some state like Alaska only as one. Yet it is unfair to compare New York with Alaska, especially since the data is made by New York city. Though even if compared internally, Staten Island in New York seem to have lower density of certified business. This information can help policymakers understand where to focus their efforts to promote diversity and support these businesses in underserved areas.

Thirdly, we can see the number of new businesses owned by minorities and women increasing over time as shown in the plot of the number of new businesses per year that is certified. This growth trend indicates that more minority- and women-owned businesses are receiving certifications over time, which is a positive sign for diversity and equity in the industry. However, there is still a need to examine the types of businesses being certified and ensure that the certification process is fair and equitable.

The broader implications of these results are that there is that we still need to promote diversity and equity in the construction industry and its related field for minority- and women-owned businesses. Policymakers need to pay attention to the geographic distribution of these businesses and provide resources and support to areas with lower representation. More importantly, the certification process itself needs to be examined to ensure that it is fair and equitable and that it is promoting diversity and inclusion, and is far from biases.

In conclusion, this analysis highlights the need for continued efforts to promote diversity and equity in the business industry, particularly for minority- and women-owned businesses. The visualizations provided in this project provide valuable insights into the distribution of these businesses and can be used to inform policymaking and support these underrepresented communities.
